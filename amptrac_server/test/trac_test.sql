Mainly laziness, so I don''t have to remember what is implemented as what (e.g. isinstance(True, int) is True).  But in this case, int and long are separate, so using assertIsInstance wouldn''t be a problem.  (Also realized I made a typo in the method name)  Changed.

Okay I implemented the "maximalist" solution instead, before this ticket turns into a kafka-esque parody of how our development process prevents anyone from ever getting anything done.  (Really?  "svn mv" is so much work that we have to start bikeshedding about alternative work-reducing approaches?)
